## NYC-Ulaanbaatar Air Quality
Comparative analysis of air pollution (PM2.5 and PM10) in New York City and Ulaanbaatar using data science techniques.

## Project Overview
This project investigates and compares air pollution patterns between New York City (USA) and Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia). The main focus is on particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), analyzing trends, seasonal variations, and potential contributing factors. The goal is to provide insights that can inform public health and environmental policy decisions.

## Research Question
How do PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in Ulaanbaatar and New York City compare, and what temporal patterns or drivers can be identified in each city?

## Data Sources
- **New York City:** NYC Open Data and AirNow/EPA for air quality measurements.  
- **Ulaanbaatar:** OpenAQ and IQAir historical air quality data.  
- **Supplemental:** NASA MODIS/VIIRS satellite AOD and SEDAC PM2.5 grids for global context.  

## Project Structure
- `data/` – Contains raw and processed datasets for both cities.  
- `src/` – Scripts for automated data retrieval, preprocessing, or modeling.  
- `README.md` – Project description and instructions.  
- `LICENSE` – MIT License for code and documentation use.
